## What I have learned about Git and GitHub in today's lesson

1. Git is a version control system used to manage the code, and track any changes locally, while GitHub is a platform used to store projects remotely.
2. There are many Git Commands can be used such as: version, add, status, diff, commit, log, checkout, merge, branch, clone, fork, add, push, and pull.
3. The most important commands are: git add, git commit, and git push.
4. If you have private information, it's preferred to use a .gitignore file to prevent them from being committed when making a commit.
5. Each commit has a unique id.
